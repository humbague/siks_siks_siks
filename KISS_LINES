Don't care, no I don't, no
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby
Sometimes, oh sometimes, I know you need a change of pace
Baby, you've got to tell me yes or no
Tell meâ€¦ 
Got you under their thumb
Out on the streets for a living
Your day is sorrow and madness
Whoo, black diamond
Darkness will fall on the city
And though you don't ask for pity
Whoo, black diamond
Out on the streets for a living
Your day is sorrow and madness
Whoo, black diamond, yeah

You know your man is workin' hard

Baby
Do it
And baby if you're feeling nice
He's worth a deuce
Yes baby if you're feeling nice
Yeah

The landlord's gone, I'm down and out
You know it'll always win
You know it's the only thing
It's time to leave and get another quart
Haha, the cheapest stuff is all I need
Ooh, it's cold gin time again
It's cold gin time again
That keeps us together, ow
Ooh, it's cold gin time again

She'll let you walk the street beside her
Ev'rybody said she's lookin' good

She gets her way just like a child
She takes you down and drives you wild
And the lady knows it's understood
I know a thing or two about her
She'll let you walk the street beside her
Everybody said she's lookin' good, and the lady knows it's understood
Strutter - look out, that girl will just pass you by
Strutter - mama, that girl will just drive you wild 
Put your two lips together and kiss

Oh yeah, mmm, someone's come along and shared your time
But you can't be his and still be mine, so
Ooh, got to choose
Oh yeah, but I ain't gonna run no race
Alright, alright, come on and tell me
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby
Who's your baby, who's your baby
You mind if I sit down for a while
Well, how could you have waited so long
All this time you put up a fear
I'm sorry to have taken so long
All this time you put up a fear
And baby won't you let me
I'm just about to, ooh yeah, ha
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
She'll adore you and she'll floor you
And you'll love it and think of it
Come on
With her love and her devotion
But you're headed for commotion
With your endless dedication
She'll remove your medication
Cause she sets my soul afire
And the flames keep gettin' higher
You'd never leave her but you know you should
You'd never leave her but you know you should
Get the firehouse
Get the firehouse
Get the firehouse
